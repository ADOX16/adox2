        <h1 id = "css">css</h1>
        <pre class = lesson>so okay css. we can add an id to any 
            thing in html and we can call it in the 
            css file using # and we can also put a class 
            and it will be mention in css using . yse a dot 
            and * means all elements.

              = descendant
            > = child
            ~ = general sibling
            + - adjacent sibling

            we can add a word after an element that trigger something
            for example : h1:hover this will trigger when hover over 
            a h1 elemnt there is also a:link used to change the propties 
            of a link and there is :active this trigger when the mouse is 
            holding the element and visited which mark a visited websites
            more on that <a id="here" href="https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?t=8952&si=ljovzS8Y0JibLRWN" target="_blank">Here</a>.
            we can also add not to any of these to reverse the order

            after an element we can add :: then a keyword to do some crazy stuff
            for example ::frirt-letter to target a first letter of something
            ::firist line , there is also ::selection we can change a selection
            ::before at the begning of a st ::after at the end.

            <dd>makes shadows for a text and the syntex goes like things
                -text-shadow : width height blur color , and we can add more 
                shadows to the text using commaa for example:
                <br><span>text-shadow : 3px 3px 5px red , 2px 2px 0px blue</span>

            and there is also margin-bottm margin-right etc......
            and there is also auto we can apply to margin which is can be used to make
            something in the middel for example</dd>

            <dd>propety specfiy how if /how and elment is displayed 
                for example :
                display : inline; this will make the div or span or whatever
                inline of the text besides it
                ,block will make the text a block like the div which means you can 
                apply a width and a height to it .
                and none it make the element invisible and make it like it didnt exict
            </dd>
            
            <dt>-visibility</dt>
            <dd>we can set it to hidden but it doesnt make the elment

            </dd>

            <dt>-position</dt>
            <dd>this can get 5 values firist is 
                <span>relative:</span> and this mean that the elemnt will be 
                positioned relative to it staring point.<span>fixed:</span>
                and this position the element relative to the viewport
                <span>absolute:</span>positioned relative to the nearest ancestor 
                the ancestor is like an elemnt inside a class for example a box
                and the elemnt is positioned in this box.<span>sticky:</span>
                which makes the element in it postion untill we scroll down then it 
                will be in top of the screen<span>static:</span>the default postion
                of the element. note that to change the postion we gotta use top , bottom
                , left , right.
            </dd>

            <dt>-background-image</dt>
            <dd>id adds a background image using this syntex:
                <br><span>background-image : url(the_background_image);</span>
                but if we made the background-image low resloution it will
                be repeated to make it not we add <span>background-repeat : no-repeat;</span>
                we can also position it using <span>background-postion</span> and like the
                postion : fixed propety we also have it in background <span>background-attachment</span>
                but after we done the picture will still be awful and not acullaly fixed so to do that
                we add this:<br><span>background-size: cover;</span>.         <a  href="upon_what.html"><pre id="uponwhat">                                                                                         ◆︎◻︎□︎■︎ ⬥︎♒︎♋︎⧫︎✍︎</pre></a>

            <dd>it let us potsion, rotate, scale, or skew an element
                using <span>transform: translateX(100px);</span> we can change the 
                postion of the element same with translateY or we can also use
                <span>translate(x, y)</span> then we have also <span>rotateX(180deg)</span>
                and also rotateY and also <span>rotateZ(90deg)</span>and for scale we use <span>
                    scalex() or scaleY() and scale()
                </span> andd finally skew they all the same. we can apply one or more 
                transformations in transform like <span>transform: translate(100px, 200px) rotateZ(45deg);</span>

        <br><hr><h1>Animations</h1>
        <pre class="lesson">Animation in css its kinda cool and tricky in here i will
            explaing everything i know in it.

            so firist to create an animation we do this syntex:
            <span>@keyframe (animation name){from{(the animation changes)}}</span>
            this "from" can be replaced to some stuff like to or a precntage
            like 100%, 69% and what does that mean is: 
            from : the anmtion is gonna go to its begning point
            to:  the animation gonna start from its begning point
            and the precntage mean that the anmaition will happen for example
            60% and come back.

            we can add more that one action to an animation but even if 
            we did an animation it still doesnt work. why?. will to make it
            work we have to add some propties to the thing we want to animate
            like this:
        </pre>

        <br><hr><h1>animation tags:</h1>
            <dl>
                <dt>-animation-name</dt>
                <dd>to make the element move we firist have to
                    call the animation name we made in it propties
                    using <span>animation-name: (animation name);</span>
                </dd>

                <dt>-animation-duration</dt>
                <dd>but even after adding the animtion to the element
                    it doesnt move why? cause we have to add an duration
                    to the animation firist so it happen in a certin time
                    we use this :<span>animation-duration</span>
                </dd>

                <dt>-animation-iteration-count</dt>
                <dd>this will tell the elemnt how many time it need
                    to repeat the animation for example: 
                    <span>animation-iteration-count: 2;</span> this 
                    will repeat the animation 2 times but if set this
                    value to <span>infinte</span> then it will repeat an 
                    infinte amount of times.
                </dd>

                <dt>-animation-direction</dt>
                <dd>this will set the way the element move for example:
                    normaly this will set like this:<span>animation-direction: normal;</span>
                    will we can change the value normal to anything else like <span>reverse</span>:
                    <div id="ani1" class="ani"></div>
                    and there is also <span>alternate</span> which gonna make the 
                    element go to its postion and return back :
                    <div id="ani2" class="ani"></div>
                    and there is also <span>alternate-reverse</span> whats do what you think:
                    <div id="ani3" class="ani"></div>
                </dd>

                <dt>-animation-play-state</dt>
                <dd>there is 2 values for this firist <span>paused</span>
                and <span>running</span> its obvious what it do and it could be
                  usefule in javascript</dd>
                
                <dt>-animation-timing-function</dt>
                <dd>the default value of this is <span>ease-in-out</span>
                which look like this: <div id="ani4" class="ani"></div>
                there is some diffrent things we can put like <span>linear</span>
                which look like this:<div id="ani5" class="ani"></div>and there 
                is also a cool thing we can add which is <span>steps()</span>
                this trigger how much steps or frames to complete the animation
                for example if we set this to 5 it will look like this:
                <div id="ani6" class="ani"></div>cool right? here is even a 
                better thing if we right click on the element and then click inspect then
                styles we can find the -animation-timing-function then we 
                we click on the purple box and a curve appear and we can make our
                own -animation-timing-function<img src="curve.png" class="pic"> then we copy the cubic bezier and paste it
                and it will move like the curve for example:<div id="ani7"></div></dd>
            </dl>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><hr>
            <pre class="lesson">well that was Css:) it was a nice journey learning it.cause
it will be helpful in the future.

look for secrets upon it.
